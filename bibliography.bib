@article{Butts2008,
	abstract = {Social behavior over short time scales is frequently understood in terms of actions, which can be thought of as discrete events in which one individual emits a behavior directed at one or more other entities in his or her environment (possibly including himself or herself). Here, we introduce a highly flexible framework for modeling actions within social settings, which permits likelihood-based inference for behavioral mechanisms with complex dependence. Examples are given for the parameterization of base activity levels, recency, persistence, preferential attachment, transitive/cyclic interaction, and participation shifts within the relational event framework. Parameter estimation is discussed both for data in which an exact history of events is available, and for data in which only event sequences are known. The utility of the framework is illustrated via an application to dynamic modeling of responder radio communications during the early hours of the World Trade Center disaster.},

@article{LeSage2008,
	abstract = {An introduction to spatial econometric models and methods is provided that discusses spatial autoregressive processes that can be used to extend conventional regression models. Estimation and interpretation of these models are illustrated with an applied example that examines the relationship between commuting to work times and transportation mode choice for a sample of 3,110 US counties in the year 2000. These extensions to conventional regression models are useful when modeling cross-sectional regional observations or and panel data samples collected from regions over both space and time can be easily implemented using publicly available software. Use of these models for the case of non-spatial structured dependence is also discussed.},

@article{Hofman2021,
	abstract = {Computational social science is more than just large repositories of digital data and the computational methods needed to construct and analyse them. It also represents a convergence of different fields with different ways of thinking about and doing science. The goal of this Perspective is to provide some clarity around how these approaches differ from one another and to propose how they might be productively integrated. Towards this end we make two contributions. The first is a schema for thinking about research activities along two dimensions—the extent to which work is explanatory, focusing on identifying and estimating causal effects, and the degree of consideration given to testing predictions of outcomes—and how these two priorities can complement, rather than compete with, one another. Our second contribution is to advocate that computational social scientists devote more attention to combining prediction and explanation, which we call integrative modelling, and to outline some practical suggestions for realizing this goal.},
